    question: "How Does Domain Monitoring Work?",
    answer:
      "Domain Monitoring technology works by monitoring top-level domain (TLD) and country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registries for newly registered domains and domain ownership status changes that could pose a risk or indicate a domain-based cyberattack. Links to malicious, fraudulent, or spoofed domains may also be identified by monitoring the public attack surface, including email and business collaboration platforms, online forums, social media, mobile app stores, blogs and news outlets, online marketplaces, and the deep and dark web. When a potential attack is identified by domain monitoring software, an alert is generated that may be reviewed by human threat intelligence experts to assess the risk and determine next-steps for preventing the attack and removing fraudulent brand assets.",

    question: "Why is Domain Monitoring Important For Your Brand?",
    answer:
      "Avoid Costly Brand and Security Incidents: When domain-based attacks target your employees, they may attempt to steal access credentials for your organization’s secure network or financial accounts. When they target your customers, they may attempt to take control of devices or commit fraud. Domain monitoring prevents cybercriminals from targeting your customers and employees with scams that could jeopardize your organization’s security posture and damage your reputation. Safeguard Customer Engagement: Domain monitoring secures the customer experience, blocking phishing and malware attacks to ensure that customers always find your authentic domain - not a fake website made by a scammer. Save Time and Money: Domain monitoring technology saves you time and money by leveraging automation to continuously monitor domain registries and the public attack surface with minimal need for manual intervention.",
