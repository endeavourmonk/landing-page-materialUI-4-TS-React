      "I'm using Domain Monitor to keep track of over 75 client domains. No more being blindsided by a domain expiration emergency! The SSL monitoring is a nice bonus and while I use another tool for uptime monitoring, I have no doubt that feature is on point. Just shows you how valuable even just the domain expiration monitoring feature is. The site and dashboard are clear, concise, and well designed. Support is top notch, above and beyond responsive, detailed, and extremely open to feedback and suggestions. Nice work!",
